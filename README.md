# pr-links
### GitHub CLI Pull Request Viewer

pr-links is a command-line tool written in Go that enhances the functionality of the GitHub CLI by displaying Pull Request information along with their URLs. The GitHub CLI itself lacks the ability to show the Pull Request URL, and this tool bridges that gap.

### Installation


### Example Output

The tool fetches open Pull Requests that are currently assigned to you and presents them in a formatted table. The table includes columns for the repository name, Pull Request ID, truncated title, and a direct link to the Pull Request on GitHub.
